# NES Development

This project is a template for begins a game for NES.

## Main issue encountered

Pointer and variables seems to be not initialized rightly after a certain section of this code.<br/>
Certainly because of too much abstractions for this compiler for NES , _and for sure my C programming skills, as a beginner :-/_


I keep this base code as archive.
